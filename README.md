# ELP_go_3TC

This is our repository for the GO project of the ELP module

The goal is to create a go script that can apply effects on an image, such as a grayscale filter or a gaussian blur. The script also has to use go routines to parallelise the task.

## Usage
To run : ```go run image_processing.go effect [parameter]``` effect is either gaussian_blur or grayscale, parameter is the radius (strength) for the gaussian blur.
